# TMAC - Task Manager API Client

A Task Manager API Client that fetches, processes, and manages task data from the JSONPlaceholder API. The focus is on modern ES6+ JavaScript practices, asynchronous programming patterns, object-oriented design, and modular code architecture. This project emphasizes backend-style JavaScript logic over UI implementation.
